# Bubble-Sort

Introduction:
This repository contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C++. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Features:
Simple Implementation: Easy to understand and modify.
Educational: Great for learning and teaching the basic principles of sorting algorithms.
Customizable: Supports sorting in ascending or descending order.
Verbose Output: Option to print the internal state of the list after each pass for educational purposes.
Time Complexity: O(n^2), suitable for small datasets and educational purposes.
